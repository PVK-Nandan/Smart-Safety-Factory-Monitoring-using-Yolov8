# 🏭 Smart Safety Factory Monitoring using YOLOv8

A real-time safety monitoring system built using **YOLOv8** to detect workers, machinery, and PPE compliance (helmets, vests, masks) inside factories and industrial environments.

This project helps improve workplace safety by automatically identifying safety rule violations and tracking worker activity.

## 🚀 Features
- ✔️ Real-time detection using YOLOv8  
- ✔️ Detects workers, helmets, vests, masks, machinery, and vehicles  
- ✔️ Flags safety rule violations (No-Helmet, No-Vest, No-Mask)  
- ✔️ Uses custom-trained dataset with 10 classes  
- ✔️ Supports image, video, and webcam detection  
- ✔️ Easy to deploy in safety monitoring systems
